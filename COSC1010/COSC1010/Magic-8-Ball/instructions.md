# Instructions  

 Write a program that simulates a Magic 8 Ball, which is a fortune telling toy that displays a random response to a yes or no question. In the student sample programs for this book, you will find a text file named 8_ball_responses.txt. The file contains 12 responses, such as “I don’t think so”, “Yes, of course!”, “I’m not sure”, and so forth. The program should read the responses from the file into a list. It should prompt the user to ask a question, then display one of the responses, randomly selected from the list. The program should repeat until the user is ready to quit.

 Contents of 8_ball_responses.txt:
 ```
 Yes, of course!
 Without a doubt, yes.
 You can count on it.
 For sure!
 Ask me later.
 I'm not sure.
 I can't tell you right now.
 I'll tell you after my nap.
 No way!
 I don't think so.
 Without a doubt, no.
 The answer is clearly NO.
